1. CERN â€“ The Birthplace

In 1989â€“1990, at CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research in Switzerland), a scientist named Tim Berners-Lee proposed a system for sharing research documents over the internet.
This system became the World Wide Web.


---

2. The Web â€“ The Big Idea

The World Wide Web is not the same as the internet.

Internet = global network of connected computers.

Web = an information system on top of the internet, using documents linked by hyperlinks.


The Web needed two main technologies to work:


---

3. HTML â€“ The Language

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the document format of the Web.

It describes the structure of a web page (headings, paragraphs, links, images, etc.).

Berners-Lee created the first version of HTML at CERN.



---

4. HTTP â€“ The Protocol

HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the set of rules for how a browser requests a web page from a server, and how the server sends it back.

Itâ€™s like the postal system for HTML pages.

Berners-Lee also created the first version of HTTP at CERN.



---

ðŸ“Œ In short:

CERN: Where Tim Berners-Lee invented the Web.

Web: The system for linking & sharing documents online.

HTML: The format of those documents.

HTTP: The protocol for transferring those documents between browsers and servers.
